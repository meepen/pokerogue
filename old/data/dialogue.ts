        `@c{smile_eclosed}We meet again.
        $@c{neutral}I've had some time to reflect on all this.\nThere's a reason this all seems so strange.
        $@c{neutral_eclosed}Your dream, my drive to beat you…\nIt's all a part of something greater.
        $@c{serious}This isn't about me, or about you… This is about the world, @c{serious_mhalf_fists}and it's my purpose to push you to your limits.
        $@c{neutral_eclosed}Whether I've fulfilled that purpose I can't say, but I've done everything in my power.
        $@c{neutral}This place we ended up in is terrifying… Yet somehow I feel unphased, like I've been here before.
        $@c{serious_mhalf_fists}You feel the same, don't you?
        $@c{serious}…and it's like something here is speaking to me.\nThis is all the world's known for a long time now.
        $Those times we cherished together that seem so recent are nothing but a distant memory.
        $@c{neutral_eclosed}Who can say whether they were ever even real in the first place.
        $@c{serious_mopen_fists}You need to keep pushing, because if you don't, it will never end. You're the only one who can do this.
        $@c{serious_smile_fists}I hardly know what any of this means, I just know that it's true.
        $@c{serious_mopen_fists}If you can't defeat me here and now, you won't stand a chance.`

        $@c{smile_eclosed}You know, I keep going around and around in my head…
        $@c{smile_ehalf}There's something to all this, why everything seems so strange now…
        $@c{smile}You have your dream, and I have this ambition in me…
        $I just can't help but feel there's a greater purpose to all this, to what we're doing, you and I.
        $@c{smile_eclosed}I think I'm supposed to push you… to your limits.
        $@c{smile_ehalf}I'm not sure if I've been doing a good job at that, but I've tried my best up to now.
        $It's something about this strange and dreadful place… Everything seems so clear…
        $This… is all the world's known for a long time now.
        $@c{smile_eclosed}It's like I can barely remember the memories we cherished together.
        $@c{smile_ehalf}Were they even real? They seem so far away now…
        $@c{angry_mopen}You need to keep pushing, because if you don't, it will never end. You're the only one who can do this.
        $I… don't know what all this means… but I feel it's true.
        $If you can't defeat me here and now, you won't stand a chance.`
